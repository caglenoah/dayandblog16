        after learning from the pre-course, and the month of practice before I began the actual bootcamp, at the start I had no idea how everything worked. It's actually something i contemplated frequently. To me it seemed like magic, and despite my best effort, or better put a major lack their of. Then my perspective grew as i understood, it compounds on itself. The next big ah ha was; as stated in previous blogs, was the visualization of the Dom tree. This helped me tie things i a step further understanding why it can do what we tell it. Where i am now their has not been another ah ha moment. Yet, my understanding continues to get deeper, and the more I learn, the more i realize i have to learn. the difference in my thinking has changed from this almost mystical world changing thing that can be used to control and manipulate people. The next transition became then, an abstract concept that i could manipulate... still mind blowing.  Even crazier than the "mystical" or the "mind-blowing" Is the fact is actually makes sense. What makes it so inctredible and special, is the fact it is just logical proccess, as logical as it can be, it can't be anything but logical. Every other intellectual discipline, I can go back to the roots, thousands of years even. As you go back you can pinpoint where and when concepts originated, the break throughs that allowed more complex thoughts to be simutaniously more elegant. But more difficult none the less.  cultures started astronomy, zero and modern day mathmatical logic arose in the middle east, etc... All of this things compound. If i try and go back to the roots of coding, is just nutz. it just gets more and more complex, it is just interesting the similarities and differences between how other intellectual pursuits evolved, and how creating not just this device, this entire interconnected world we live in.

        Oh gosh, i have never been able to apply myself like this. It has triggered and entire growth process, as you re-wire your brain, you re-write, or more importantly are given the oppurtunity to turn off switches that led to old loops, OOOOOOOHHH the lies we tell ourselves. Who'da thunk tauwkin tu ah puuuutre mayak u sow smurt! Also even though this is taking up pretty much all of my time, my ability to anylyze, rationalize, and practice mindfulness in every aspect of my life has improved, it has giving me hope for a future in which i didnt see success despite my resolve and tenacity for life. That increased optomism has even allowed me to find peace, even in high emotion or dangerouse situation. (If you actually read this ask me about my clear creek kayaking run from the other day. My god, dont code thirteen days straight then jump straight back into kayaking IV+ manky, sketchy, shallow, super fun ;), cold colorado white water at Higher water than we have had i 5 years. The problem solving that took place as a result to my mistake, and a strangers is super cool and is such a similar way of breaking things down mentally. Except less frusterating, cause if you mess up fixing your mess up frusteration is not the experience... theres been a few bodies pulled out of that river this year.

    Where I want. Because i have been struggling, and pushing, and failing, and have had more life experience (mostly due to my own learning style of figurig it out the hard way), and some life happens. I am looking at a trajectory with a good trend for the first time in my life (past a three month horizon). Regardless of what happens with coding. My intentions are clearer, my trauma is peeling, what a gift this has been as a catalyst.

Making apps that can benefit people pull themselves up by themselve. Motivation isnt enough if you cant re-write your sub-concious to change habits. It is just a painful ever degrading cycle. Your stuck in the hole. Meds, self medication, toxic behaviors, everything stems from our need to feel safe and protected. With out access to that information or the resources. You cannot break the cycle. Once i have paid my dues, i would like to start up as many non-profits (water water education as i can reaching out to underpriveledged communities, while creating content/ application that are affordable, and low entry use-ability. Make apps that teach you, how to teach you. So you dont need to sit in a class, or leave the kid at day car. You can take a peak at your phone while your taking a dump in between your dropping your kids off at a friends and heading to your second job. Just things that can give people food for thought, validation retaining its value through constructive critisism. The outdoor aspect is where my purpose lies. I do not have the skills to achieve that at the moment, but if i can figure out how to build this stuff just using resources. I certainly can figure out how to write up an apeal and get rich people to donate for some tax breaks! Better yet, ill be the rich person and can just give as needed. Lonelyness, self pity, anger, those dont https://caglenoah.github.io/101-finalportfolio/ when we are living a life of percieved purpose. Those are defense mechanisms, so the key to happyness in life is tricking your brain into beleiving that even though this reality might not need me, if im needed here i am making it better for other people. How can you be lonely if your presence can spark life into other people?

    you can  write css directly in the html 
    <style></style> <script> </script> 
    You have the doctype
    a specified language
    the head (choosing character set, viewport/other meta data( how the browser reads, and renders document to a page), links to any repos/folders that contain information on how the document will render.
    body
    :nth-of-type()  
    </p>   
    <p>
    "nth" just represents the "nth" in "ninth" it is just a way of declaring a number. of-type() is going to call a specific type of element. 
    
    ex:::     div:nth-of-type(2) selects the second element of all (object type) div siblings
    
    ex:::     div:nth-of-child(2) selects the second element of (object type) div siblings

    I have not been able to keep up with what is new! Having the set templates is nice. Probably should have been using that instead of hand-typing code when I'm 12 projects behind.
